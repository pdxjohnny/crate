This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Added cluster checks that warn if some tables need to be recreated so that
  they are compatible with future versions of CrateDB >= 3.0.0.

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed: Bootstrap fails with error when ``ingestion.mqtt.enabled`` is
   defined when ``license.enterprise`` is set to false.

 - Fixed an issue where the query circuit breaker would be tripped after
   running several queries due to incorrect memory tracking. Subsequent
   operations would've failed due to the lack of circuit breaker cleanup.

 - Improve shards view performance in the Admin UI

 - Remove horizontal scroll from the console editor in the Admin UI.
